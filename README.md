**A tensor object is an object that can be represented as an array.**

**Put simply, a vector in maths is what we call a list
in Python or a 1-dimensional array in NumPy.**

**A dot product of two vectors is a sum of products of consecutive vector elements. Both vectors
must be of the same size (have an equal number of elements).**
