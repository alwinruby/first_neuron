### Summary


The partial derivative of the sum with respect to any input equals 1.

The partial derivative of the multiplication operation with 2 inputs, with respect to any input,
equals the other input.

The partial derivative of the max function of 2 variables with respect to any of them is 1 if this
variable is the biggest and 0 otherwise.

The derivative of the max function of a single variable and 0 equals 1 if the variable is greater than
0 and 0 otherwise.

The derivative of chained functions equals the product of the partial derivatives of the subsequent
functions.

The same applies to the partial derivatives.

The gradient is a vector of all possible partial derivatives.
